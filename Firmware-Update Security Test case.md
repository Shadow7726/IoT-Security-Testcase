# Firmware Update

| **Vulnerability**               | **Description**                                                               | **Steps to Perform**                                                                                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lack of Update Mechanism        | Some IoT devices lack a firmware update mechanism, leaving them vulnerable to known exploits. | 1. Ensure all devices have a mechanism for firmware updates.<br>2. Prefer automatic, over-the-air updates.<br>3. Design updates to be user-friendly and require minimal interaction. |
| Unsigned Firmware / Unsigned Firmware Updates | Firmware lacks cryptographic signature, allowing installation of malicious updates. | 1. Create a malicious firmware image.<br>2. Host the malicious firmware on a server.<br>3. Trick the device into downloading and installing the fake update.<br>1. Implement firmware signing using the latest cryptographic standards.<br>2. Ensure devices validate the signature of the firmware before installation.<br>3. Regularly update signing keys and algorithms to maintain security. |
| Insecure Update Channel / Insecure Firmware Update Channels | Updates transmitted over unencrypted channels can be intercepted and replaced by attackers. | 1. Set up a man-in-the-middle attack.<br>2. Intercept firmware update traffic.<br>3. Modify or replace the firmware package.<br>4. Allow the modified package to be installed on the device.<br>1. Use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS, TLS) for firmware updates.<br>2. Implement encryption to protect firmware during transmission.<br>3. Regularly audit and update communication security protocols to ensure they meet current standards. |
| Rollback Vulnerabilities / Firmware Rollback | Device allows downgrade to older, vulnerable versions that have known vulnerabilities. | 1. Obtain an older firmware version with known vulnerabilities.<br>2. Force the device to enter update mode.<br>3. Install the older firmware version.<br>4. Exploit known vulnerabilities in the older firmware.<br>1. Prevent firmware rollback without specific vendor authorization.<br>2. Implement controls to verify and authorize any rollback process.<br>3. Track and log firmware versions to detect and prevent unauthorized rollbacks. |
| Insufficient Validation         | Device doesn't properly verify firmware integrity                            | 1. Modify a legitimate firmware package.<br>2. Ensure the package maintains the expected structure.<br>3. Deliver the modified firmware to the device.<br>4. Exploit the lack of thorough validation for successful installation.<br>1. Implement strict verification procedures for all firmware updates.<br>2. Ensure firmware updates are tested and validated before deployment.<br>3. Use checksums or other verification methods to confirm the integrity of firmware updates. |
| Hard-coded Update Credentials / Hardcoded or Embedded Credentials | Firmware may contain hardcoded or embedded plaintext credentials, which can be discovered and exploited by attackers. | 1. Extract and analyze the firmware.<br>2. Locate hard-coded credentials.<br>3. Use the credentials to authenticate and push malicious updates.<br>1. Avoid using hardcoded or embedded plaintext credentials in firmware.<br>2. Use secure methods to handle credentials, such as encryption or secure key storage.<br>3. Regularly review and update credential handling practices to address new threats. |
| Lack of Secure Boot             | No verification of boot process integrity                                    | 1. Modify the bootloader or early boot stages.<br>2. Install a compromised firmware.<br>3. Exploit the lack of boot verification to run malicious code.                     |
| Vulnerabilities in Proprietary Binaries | Attackers can find vulnerabilities in proprietary binaries through static or dynamic analysis. | 1. Conduct regular static and dynamic analysis of firmware binaries.<br>2. Use reverse-engineering tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.<br>3. Employ a robust code review process and penetration testing to discover and address vulnerabilities before deployment. |
| Update Server Compromise        | Vulnerabilities in the update infrastructure                                 | 1. Identify vulnerabilities in the update server.<br>2. Exploit these vulnerabilities to gain access.<br>3. Replace legitimate firmware with malicious versions.<br>4. Wait for devices to download and install the compromised firmware. |
